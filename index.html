<h1 class="text-center">About 256</h1>
<p>It all started around 1990 on an old hp calculator with a game called Hamurabi, written before we landed on the moon. This was the first game Daniel modified, and his first exposure to code. It was all downhill from there. He spent his childhood years experimenting with languages like QBasic, C, and C++. He also experimented with 3D modeling and made maps for games like Quake and Quake II.<p>
<p>Daniel Lambert started the idea of 256 after running a counterstrike clan of the same name in and around 1999. The name "256" stuck with him through the next twenty years. After working on many personal projects, prototypes, and at other companies, 256 Games was spawned.<p>
<p>He wrote his first terrain engine in the Glide API and C++ around that time. After a short time going to school for 3D modeling and animation in Santa Cruz, California and then electrical engineering in Grant's Pass, Oregon, he joined the Air Force. Stationed at McGuire AFB in New Jersey, he was the guy in the dorms who would host LAN parties, and had several computers set up in his small room. He became a Flying Crew Chief on KC-10s and would frequently be in the air, sitting on his alienware laptop, working on various simulations and prototypes.</p>
<p>Once his Enlistment was up, he moved to Battle Creek, Michigan and worked for Duncan Aviation as a Falcon and Citation airframe specialist. While working for Duncan, he started working on an associates in computer programming with honors. It was not to be though, as life gets in the way. With only an accounting class left to finish his degree, he packed what he could carry in a couple of duffel bags and moved to Boise, Idaho.<p>
<p>He started on a degree in Computer Science at Boise State University, where he did well enough that in his second semester that he was recruited by one of his instructors to work on systems engineering and software development for a research project with NASA.<p>

<p>After two years of paid and unpaid research plus school, he decided he was ready to found a game development company. He started working on his own projects, and the opportunity came up for him to found a company with some friends. Partywipe Studios was born. At Partywipe he worked as lead developer, lead designer, and training manager. He developed a mobile augmented reality MMO game that they presented at several conventions.<p>
<p>The game never took off though, and after three years of unpaid work, Daniel decided to go back to school. He decided to continue his Computer Science degree and also added on a major in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology. First semester back, he was recruited onto another research team developing heads up displays for space suits with NASA.<p>
<p>That leads us to now. Expecting some time to spare over the summer, and considering the possibility that he may not return to school, 256 Games is resurrected.<p>
